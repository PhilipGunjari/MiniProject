About the FVC 2000 Dataset:

Full name: Fingerprint Verification Competition 2000 Dataset (FVC2000)

FVC2000 is a standard fingerprint dataset released during the First International Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC 2000).  
It was designed to benchmark fingerprint verification algorithms by providing a diverse, real-world collection of fingerprint images.

The FVC2000 dataset contains:

- Four databases: `DB1`, `DB2`, `DB3`, and `DB4`.
- Each database has:
  - 100 fingers (i.e., 100 subjects).
  - 8 fingerprint images per finger (total: 800 images per database).
- The images are from different sensors or synthetic generators to simulate real-world variation.

Image Details:

- Images are grayscale.
- Quality and variations include:
  - Distortions (rotation, translation, pressure differences).
  - Partial fingerprints.
  - Different acquisition conditions (wet/dry fingers, noisy sensors).

Important Points:

- DB1, DB2, DB3: Real-world fingerprint images from real sensors.
- DB4: Fully synthetic fingerprints but designed to imitate real fingerprints closely.
- License: Typically restricted for academic and research use only. Always credit the FVC2000 source in publications.
